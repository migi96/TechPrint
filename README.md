*Overview
TechPrint is tailored for developers seeking a modern spin on the classic printf function. With its design echoing the precision and sophistication of computer hardware, it guarantees efficiency and ease of use.

File Breakdown
1. motherboard.h: The central hub. This header consolidates all necessary prototypes, macros, and library inclusions, serving as the backbone of our system.

2. cpu_core.c: The powerhouse. Encompassing the primary TechPrint function, it processes and dictates every output operation.

3. ram_parser.c: Storing and analyzing format strings with speed, ensuring every output is processed seamlessly.

4. bus_flags.c: An intersection for output control signals. Handles the essential flags to guide our formatting journey.

5. register_width.c: Regulates the space each output occupies. Precision is key, and collisions are unheard of.

6. cache_precision.c: Just as L1 and L2 caches boost performance, this manages the decimal precision, ensuring clarity in every print.

7. transistor_length.c: Like transistors modulating electrical signals, this file fine-tunes length modulations in our formatted output.

8. chip_char.c: Ensuring every character finds its slot on the chip, it manages the printing of individual characters.

9. drive_string.c: As drives store sequences of data, this handles strings, ensuring they're displayed with clarity.

10. port_int.c: For direct data transfer. It governs integer representation in the print stream.

11. gpio_unsigned.c: Tackles the general-purpose unsigned integers, versatile and pivotal for data representation.

12. rom_octal.c: Just as ROMs hold boot instructions, this carves out numbers in their octal format.

13. bios_hex.c: Delves deep into the system's roots to print hexadecimal formatted numbers.

14. addressbus_pointer.c: Pointers navigate through memory. This ensures they're represented with precision on the print stream.

15. fpu_float.c: Just like Floating Point Units process decimals, this ensures they're printed accurately.

16. lan_percent.c: A nod to local networking, this ensures the % character is broadcasted perfectly on your print stream.

*How to Use
To harness the power of TechPrint, embed the motherboard.h header in your source. Once done, deploy TechPrint similarly to printf. Detailed format specifiers can be found in the documentation.

*Getting Started
For integration instructions, see our detailed guide on how to swiftly integrate TechPrint into your next groundbreaking project.

*Prerequisites:
Before you get started, ensure you have the following tools:

A compatible C development environment.
gcc or any preferred C compiler.
Basic knowledge of terminal or command-line operations.

*Installation Steps:

1- Directory Creation (Optional):

Create a directory where you want to store all TechPrint related files:

mkdir techprint && cd techprint

2- Retrieve Source Files:

If TechPrint is hosted online, you can clone it. Otherwise, move the provided source files into the directory

git clone https://github.com/migi96/TechPrint.git.

3- Compiling the Source Files:

Compile all the source files to generate object files for each.

gcc -c cpu_core.c ram_parser.c bus_flags.c register_width.c cache_precision.c transistor_length.c chip_char.c drive_string.c port_int.c gpio_unsigned.c rom_octal.c bios_hex.c addressbus_pointer.c fpu_float.c lan_percent.c

This command produces object files (*.o) for each source file.

4- Building the Static Library:

To use TechPrint efficiently, it's recommended to create a static library. This bundles all functionalities into a single file.

ar -rc libtechprint.a *.o

The result is a static library named libtechprint.a.

Cleanup:

After creating the library, remove intermediate object files to declutter:

rm *.o

5- Integration in Your Project:

First, copy the libtechprint.a and motherboard.h into your project's directory.

In your C program, include the motherboard.h header:

#include "motherboard.h"

While compiling your program, link it against the libtechprint.a static library:

gcc your_program.c -L. -ltechprint -o your_program_output

Here, replace your_program.c with your source file's name and your_program_output with the desired output executable name.

Testing:
To verify the successful installation of TechPrint:

1- Write a test program (test.c):

#include "motherboard.h"

int main() {
    TechPrint("Hello, TechPrint!\n");
    return 0;
}

2- Compile and run:

gcc test.c -L. -ltechprint -o test_output && ./test_output

If everything went correctly, you should see "Hello, TechPrint!" printed on the terminal.
